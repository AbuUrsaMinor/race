## Note on File Sizes

Audio files can significantly impact your game's loading time. Consider these options if file size is a concern:

1. Use lower bitrate MP3s (64kbps is often sufficient for sound effects)
2. Trim unnecessary silence from the beginning and end of files
3. Convert stereo to mono for sound effects (not for music)
4. Consider using shorter loops for background music
