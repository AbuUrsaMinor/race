# Race Game Audio Implementation

This document summarizes the audio enhancements for the Race Game.

## Audio Integration Overview

The game has been set up with support for these key audio elements:

1. **Background Music** - Retro/synthwave style music
2. **Engine Sounds** - Car engine revving with variable pitch
3. **Braking Effects** - Tire screeching on brake press
4. **Traffic Sounds** - Ambient passing cars sounds

## Implementation Details

### 1. Audio Files Structure

The game expects these audio files in the `/public/audio/` directory:
- `music.mp3` - Background music
- `engine.mp3` - Engine sound effect
- `brake.mp3` - Brake sound effect
- `traffic.mp3` - Traffic ambient sound

### 2. Audio Fallback System

The `AudioManager` class has been enhanced with:
- Better path resolution for both development and production environments
- Path fallback system to support both local testing and GitHub Pages deployment
- Synthetic audio generation as a failsafe when audio files aren't found

### 3. Audio Testing Tools

Created tools to help with audio implementation:
- `/public/test-audio.html` - Browser-based audio testing page
- `/docs/audio_integration_guide.md` - Detailed guide for audio integration
- `/docs/recommended_audio_files.md` - Specific recommended files from Pixabay
- `/download_audio_helpers.ps1` - PowerShell script to create placeholder files

## Usage Instructions

1. Follow the instructions in `docs/recommended_audio_files.md` to download appropriate audio
2. Place all downloaded files in the `/public/audio/` directory
3. Test your audio using the `/public/test-audio.html` page
4. Run the game to experience the enhanced audio experience

## Technical Notes

- The AudioManager supports both production paths (with /race/ prefix) and development paths
- Volume control for both music and sound effects is implemented
- Audio is properly handled through gain nodes for better mixing
- The engine sound features pitch variation based on speed
