# Audio Files for Race Game

This directory should contain the following audio files for the game:

1. `music.mp3` - Background music (synthwave/retrowave style)
2. `engine.mp3` - Car engine revving sound
3. `brake.mp3` - Tire screeching sound
4. `traffic.mp3` - Ambient traffic noise

## Getting Audio Files

1. Check the `docs/recommended_audio_files.md` file for direct links to suggested Pixabay audio files
2. Download the recommended files or find your own on Pixabay
3. Rename the files to match the names listed above
4. Place all files in this directory

## Testing Your Audio Files

After downloading and placing the files in this directory, you can test them by:

1. Opening `/public/test-audio.html` in your web browser
2. Playing each audio file to verify it works correctly
3. Testing the "Play All Together" feature to hear how they blend

## Troubleshooting

If your audio files don't work:
- Make sure the filenames are exact (music.mp3, engine.mp3, etc.)
- Check that the files are valid MP3 format
- Verify your browser can play MP3 audio
- Try different audio files if needed

Note: The game includes a fallback audio generator if files are not found, but real audio files provide a much better gaming experience.
